### Jasmine Set Up

Working template for jasmine

1. Replace 'YourClassHere' in all filenames and js files. This includes the SpecRunner.html file.

2. Test should return true when complete.



Specification:




Power saving mode is on by default but it can also be turned off

You can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function

You can ask about the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is low-usage, <= 25 is medium-usage, anything else is high-usage.
(In the challenges where we add an interface, low-usage will be indicated with green, medium-usage indicated with black, high-usage indicated with red.)
